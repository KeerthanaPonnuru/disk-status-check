Test Case: Testing SSH Connectivity using Password and Key Based Authentication

Scenario
Test the SSH connectivity to a remote server using both password-based and key-based authentication methods.

Setup
1. Server Configuration:
   - Ensure the SSH server is running on the remote machine.
   - The server should have a user account with password authentication enabled.
   - The server should have SSH public key authentication enabled and the public key of the test client added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

2. Client Configuration:
   - Ensure the SSH client is installed.
   - The client should have access to the private key corresponding to the public key on the server.
   - The client should have the username and password for the server account.

Tools Used
- `ssh` command for SSH connectivity.
- `ssh-keygen` for generating SSH keys (if needed).
- A script or automation tool (e.g., Python, Bash) to automate the test.

Test Steps
1. Password-Based Authentication:
   - Execute the SSH command using the username and password: `ssh user@remote-server`.
   - Check if the connection is successful and the user can log in.
   - Record the connection status and any error messages.

2. Key-Based Authentication:
   - Ensure the SSH agent is running and the private key is added: `ssh-add /path/to/private/key`.
   - Execute the SSH command using the username and private key: `ssh -i /path/to/private/key user@remote-server`.
   - Check if the connection is successful and the user can log in.
   - Record the connection status and any error messages.

Teardown
- Close the SSH sessions.
- Remove any test files or configurations created during the test.

Pass/Fail Criteria
- Password-Based Authentication:
  - Pass: The user can successfully log in using the password.
  - Fail: The user cannot log in using the password.

- Key-Based Authentication:
  - Pass: The user can successfully log in using the private key.
  - Fail: The user cannot log in using the private key.
